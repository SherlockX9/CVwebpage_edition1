                    <p>
                        I love playing football. At school, with friends, weekends or weekdays, I'm always up for a game of football.

                    <p>
                        Since I read my first crime fiction book during my last year at primary school, I have never stopped being interested in reading fiction novels.
                         Crime and drama is my favourite genre, with Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie Anthony Horrowitz and Lee Child being my favourite authors.
                        
                         I also like reading the latest news on finanance and technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with football, I like to play tennis and badminton.
