                        I love badminton and play it regularly with friends, as well as football and table tennis. I also really enjoy reading.

                        Since I read my first crime fiction book during my last year at primary school, I have never stopped being interested in reading fiction novels.
                         Crime and drama is my favourite genre, with Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and Robert Ludlam being my favourite authors.
                        
                         I also like reading the latest news on finanance and technology.
