                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p> In this project I created a visual button that switched between showing 'Walk' with a green background, to 'Stop' with a red background. 
                    I made use of <em>if</em> statements and <em>else if</em> blocks.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p> In this second project I incorporated <em> for </em> loops and designed a grid that starts with a large amount of bricks in a row, and another row is created on top
                        of that each time you click the screen, with one less brick and a random fill colour.
                     </p>

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p> I developed a basic 2d-game, making use of classes and objects along with <em>if</em> statements and <em>for</em> loops. The game consists of ball objects which drop from the top of the screen, and theres a rectangular slider
            object which can be moved left and right using certain keys, and each time the ball hits the slider, the score increments by one.  </p> <br>
